# new-react-application

A React application set up conveniently from scratch

Hello everyone,

This repository is a boilerplate that can be used for bootstrapping web applications using the React JavaScript library.

I am aware that there are easier ways of doing it using convenient tools like `create-react-app` but I like doing things from the ground up in essence. I went through lots of resources and set up a boilerplate which is configured with:

* Webpack 4
* Babel 7
* Support for SASS/SCSS stylesheets
* Basic React project configurations

The project structure is left as simple as it could be so you can move things around to your convenience. Happy coding :)
